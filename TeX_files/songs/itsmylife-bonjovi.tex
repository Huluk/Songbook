  \songsection{Verse 1}
  This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
  No silent prayer for the faith-departed
  I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
  You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

  \smallskip
  \songsection{Chorus}
  It's my life, it's now or never
  I ain't gonna live forever
  I just want to live while I'm alive
  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
  Like Frankie said, ``I did it my way''
  I just wanna live while I'm alive
  It's my life
  \smallskip

  \songsection{Verse 2}
  This is for the ones who stood their ground
  For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
  Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
  Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

  \songsection{Chorus}
  \songsnippet{It's my life...}

  \songsection{Bridge}
  Better stand tall when they're calling you out
  Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

  \songsection{Chorus}
  \songsnippet{It's my life...}

  \songsection{Chorus, final}
  And it's now or never
  I ain't gonna live forever
  I just want to live while I'm alive
  (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
  Like Frankie said, ``I did it my way''
  I just wanna live while I'm alive
  It's my life
