	\songsection{Don Quixote, Verse 1}
  Hear me now
  Oh thou bleak and unbearable world,
  Thou art base and debauched as can be;
  And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
  Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

  \songsection{Don Quixote, Original Chorus}
  I am I, Don Quixote,
  The Lord of La Mancha,
  My destiny calls and I go,
  And the wild winds of fortune
  Will carry me onward,
  Oh whithersoever they blow.
  Whithersoever they blow,
  Onward to glory I go!

  \songsection{(Don Quixote, Chorus, Alternate Christopher Lee Version)}
  I am I, Don Quixote,
  The Lord of La Mancha,
  Destroyer of evil am I?
  I will march to the sound
  of the trumpets of glory,
  Forever to conquer or die.

  \songsection{Sancho Panza, Chorus}
  I'm Sancho! Yes, I'm Sancho!
  I'll follow my master till the end.
  I'll tell all the world proudly
  I'm his squire! I'm his friend!

  \songsection{Don Quixote, Verse 2}
  Hear me, heathens and wizards
  And serpents of sin!
  All your dastardly doings are past,
  For a holy endeavor is now to begin
  And virtue shall triumph at last!

  \songsection{Both their original Chorus}

  \songsection{Both}
  Whithersoever they blow,
  Onward to glory I {we} go!
